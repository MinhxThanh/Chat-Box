**Privacy Policy for Chat Box**

**Last Updated:** June 18, 2025

Thank you for using Chat Box. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use our Chrome extension.

**1. Information We Do Not Collect**

We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data to our servers. All data you provide is stored locally on your computer.

**2. Information You Provide**

*   **API Keys:** To connect to AI services like OpenAI, DeepSeek, Claude, Groq, Firecrawl, and Jina AI, you need to enter your API keys. These keys are stored exclusively in your browser's local storage. They are only used to communicate with the respective API providers and are never sent to us.
*   **Chat History:** Your conversations with the AI models are saved in your browser's local storage for your convenience. This allows you to access your past chats. This data is not accessible to us.
*   **Uploaded Documents and Images:** When you upload documents or images for interaction, they are processed locally and sent directly to the selected AI model. They are not stored on our servers.

**3. How Your Information Is Used**

*   Your API keys are used to authenticate you with the AI and search providers you choose to use.
*   Your chat history is used to display your past conversations within the extension.
*   The content of your chats, uploaded documents, and images are sent to the AI provider you have selected to get a response.

**4. Third-Party Services**

The extension allows you to connect to third-party AI and search services. Your interactions with these services are subject to their respective privacy policies. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party service you connect to through Chat Box.

**5. Security**

We take reasonable measures to protect your information within the extension. Since all sensitive data is stored locally on your device, the security of your data largely depends on the security of your own computer and browser.

**6. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
