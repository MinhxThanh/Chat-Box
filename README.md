### Using with Local LLMs (e.g., Ollama)

You can configure Chat Box to work with local LLMs like those served by Ollama.

1.  **Run your Ollama server**:
    Open your terminal and run the following command. This makes Ollama accessible to the extension.
    ```bash
    OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0 OLLAMA_PORT=11434 OLLAMA_ORIGINS='*' ollama serve
    ```
    *   `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0`: Allows connections from any network interface.
    *   `OLLAMA_PORT=11434`: Standard Ollama port.
    *   `OLLAMA_ORIGINS='*'`: Allows requests from any origin, necessary for the Chrome extension to connect.

2.  **Configure Chat Box Settings**:
    -   Go to the Chat Box **Settings** panel.
    -   For **Endpoint**, enter: `http://localhost:11434/v1`
    -   For **API Key**, enter: `no-key` (Ollama's OpenAI-compatible endpoint doesn't strictly require a key, but the field might be mandatory in the UI. Any non-empty string should work).
    -   Click "Load Models" to see models available from your Ollama instance.
